  <h1>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h1>
  <p>Progressive enhancement in web development is an important concept to consider that is focused on making the content of the site accesible to as many people as possible. This involves starting with a solid foundation in the HTML layer that can run on any browser or device and that can be built upon using CSS and JS. This ensures that anyone can access the content as well as providing a base level that will show if there are issues with the functionality of the CSS and JS. When I first started this class, I was pleasantly surprised by how much attention was given to making sure our code was accessible. It made a lot of sense but I had not considered doing so before this class.</p> 
  <p>I think progressive enhancement is important in web development because I place a lot of value in accessibility. The content of websites is what matters most and the whole point of making websites is so that people will visit it. If you are shutting out groups of people by not making sure that it is accessible, then people will rightly stop visiting the site. It also helps improve the consistency of quality control of sites. A strong foundational layer of HTML can be understood by other people and helps save time when debugging isues.</p>

  <h1>Reflection</h1>
  <p>This class was one of my favorites this semester and I had a blast creating these sites. Instruction was thorough and clear and I was able to follow along perfectly well every class, which I cannot say for previous courses. I think I did well on attending class and participating in discussion which I have not usually been good about. I also think I have had a good grasp of all the concepts taught. I learned how important it is to make our sites accessible; how to create graphics to use on a site; and how to utilize outside sources to add to my site like Wufoo. I have saved several sites that I learned about in class in my bookmarks that I plan to use in future classes.</p>
  <p>If I had to start over, I would definitely put a lot more time into the design of my home page. I wanted to but it was not high on my prority list for the semester. I don't consider myself a very creative person design-wise so I plan to push myself in future classes to take the extra time to practice that. I would also try to improve my time management (I already say this every semester anyway). </p>
  <p>I recieved feedback from my partner who suggested changes to section colors and helped select the images used in the slick carousel. She was mostly satisfied with the site and did not offer suggestions that I didn't use.</p>
